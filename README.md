# AI Systems Lab — Portfolio by Adi Wira Pratama

Welcome! This repository showcases my end-to-end work in AI Engineering, Agentic Systems, Applied Machine Learning, and Full Stack Web Development.

My focus: AI that interacts with tools, manages state, solves real problems, and produces actual outputs.

## 1. ARC Agent — Autonomous Affinity Diagram Maker

**Tech:** OpenAI tool-calling, Node/TypeScript, Paper.js, server-side SVG/PNG rendering.

ARC Agent is an end-to-end autonomous system that generates complete Affinity/Relation (Activity Relationship Chart) diagrams directly from natural-language descriptions. It parses item lists, generates reasons, assigns A–O–U–E–I scores, auto-completes the full pairwise matrix, resolves missing or inconsistent structure, and renders polished SVG/PNG diagrams via a Paper.js backend.

This project demonstrates coordinated tool-calling, stateful multi-step agent loops, and automated engineering visualization in a production-ready workflow.
