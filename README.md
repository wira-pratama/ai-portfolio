# AI Systems Lab — Portfolio by Adi Wira Pratama

Welcome! This repository showcases my end-to-end work in AI Engineering, Agentic Systems, Applied Machine Learning, and Backend Tool-Calling Architecture.

My focus: AI that interacts with tools, manages state, solves real problems, and produces actual outputs.

## 1. ARC Agent — Autonomous Affinity Diagram Maker

**Tech:** GPT tool-calling, Node/TypeScript, Paper.js, Express/Oak, server-side SVG/PNG rendering.

The ARC Agent is an autonomous system that fully automates the construction of Affinity/Relation (ARC/ARD/SRD) diagrams—traditionally done manually in Industrial Engineering.

The agent can:
- parse natural-language input describing components or locations  
- add all items automatically  
- generate relation reasons  
- assign A–O–U–E–I relationship scores  
- fill the entire pairwise relation matrix  
- detect and fix missing structure or asymmetries  
- finalize everything and send it to a dedicated Paper.js render server  
- output clean SVG/PNG diagrams programmatically  

This showcases complex tool orchestration, stateful agent loops, and automated engineering visualization.
